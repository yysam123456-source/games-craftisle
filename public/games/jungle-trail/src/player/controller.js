/* First-person walker.
 *
 * The camera is the whole interface, so it gets more attention than the input.
 * Three things separate a camera that feels like a person from one that feels
 * like a flying tripod:
 *
 *  - Weight. Acceleration and damping on the velocity, not direct assignment,
 *    so starting and stopping take a moment.
 *  - Gait. The head rises and falls twice per stride and rolls once, because
 *    it is on top of a spine that is being alternately supported by two legs.
 *  - Being held. Even standing still, a real camera drifts. The handheld noise
 *    never stops, and it is the single cheapest thing that stops footage
 *    looking computer-generated.
 *
 * Ground contact is still sampled directly from the procedural heightfield,
 * but jumping gets one vertical ballistic degree of freedom. Keeping horizontal
 * collision and vertical contact separate prevents a landing on a root from
 * tunnelling the eye into the terrain.
