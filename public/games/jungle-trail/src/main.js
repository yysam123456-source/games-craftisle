     * overcast day in a car park, and it was the single loudest wrong note in
     * the first vegetation pass. */

     * shadow. Almost nothing at eye level here is lit directly, so this pair is
     * what is actually lighting the picture — a shadow that goes neutral grey
     * is the difference between a forest and a car park at dusk. */

     * exposures — small mustard highlights on the canopy against black
     * understory — which is what happens when nearly all the fill is coming
     * from a sun that only reaches a few per cent of the surfaces. A closed
     * forest is lit almost entirely by this term, and more of it (with less
     * chroma in it) is what turns a set of lit objects in the dark back into
     * one space full of soft green light. */
    /* The level was raised again once alpha-to-coverage came off the leaves.
     * A2C had been leaking bright background through a fraction of the MSAA
     * samples at nearly every foliage pixel, and that leak was carrying a
     * surprising amount of the frame's apparent exposure — removing the
     * artefact took the median luminance down by a third, which is the sort of
     * thing that is easy to mistake for a lighting change and chase in the
     * wrong file. This is the honest amount of fill needed to light the
     * understory now that nothing is being lit by a bug. */
    /* The ground term was raised harder than the sky term, because it is the
     * one that lights a trunk. A hemisphere light weights its two colours by
     * the surface normal's y, so a vertical bole — and the underside of every
     * leaf above it — sees the average of the pair rather than the sky colour,
     * and with a dark ground term that average was low enough that any trunk
     * standing in the canopy's own shadow went to near black regardless of how
     * pale its bark map was. A rainforest floor is wet mid-brown litter with a
     * good deal of bounce in it, so the previous near-black value was not
     * defensible on physical grounds either. */
    /* Trimmed in the ninth pass. A hemisphere light is by construction the
     * least directional light there is — it varies only with the surface
     * normal's y — so it is simultaneously the thing keeping the understory
     * out of the black and the thing flattening it. The critique's fourth
     * finding was "no sense of light direction", and the honest first move is
     * to stop spending quite so much of the exposure on a term that cannot
     * have one, and to let the sun and the leaves' own transmission lobe
     * carry the difference. Dappled light through the canopy is a later
     * system and is not being attempted here. */
    /* The sky term lost most of its yellow in the tenth pass at the same
     * luminance. A green ambient multiplying a green albedo is squaring the
     * hue, and the two together were pushing every lit leaf toward the same
     * chartreuse regardless of what its atlas said — pale ones came out cream,
     * which is the "muddy but inconsistent colour" finding. Real shade under a
     * canopy is filtered, but it is also skylight, so it belongs on the cool
     * side of green rather than the warm one. The ground term stays warm and
     * stays brown: that half is bounce off wet litter and it is the only thing
     * keeping the underside of anything from reading as grey. */
    /* Trimmed again when the canopy fill arrived, and the amount matters less
     * than what it was replaced with. A hemisphere light is the least
     * directional light there is and it was carrying nearly the whole frame,
     * which is a complete account of why the middle distance read as one flat
     * wall: every surface at a given normal.y was receiving exactly the same
     * light no matter where in the world it stood. Most of that budget now
     * goes through canopyFill() in render/canopy.js, which is the same idea
     * with the roof's own thickness modulating it, so a thin patch of canopy
