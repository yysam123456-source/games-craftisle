/* Vegetation: materials, placement and instancing.
 *
 * Three problems have to be solved together here, and solving any one of them
 * in isolation breaks the other two.
 *
 * 1. Leaves are not opaque. A leaf lit from behind glows, and a canopy seen
 *    from underneath is mostly backlit — so a forest rendered with a normal
 *    opaque BRDF is a forest of black cutouts, which is exactly what most
 *    real-time foliage looks like. The transmission term below is the single
 *    largest visual difference in this file.
 *
 * 2. Everything moves. Not much, and not fast — the understory of a rainforest
 *    is nearly still — but a completely static frame reads as a photograph of
 *    a diorama. The wind is deliberately small in amplitude and long in period.
 *
 * 3. There are tens of thousands of plants and they must cost almost nothing
 *    when off screen. Instancing alone does not do this: one InstancedMesh
 *    spanning the level has a bounding sphere the size of the level, so it is
 *    never frustum-culled and every instance is submitted every frame. The
 *    instances are therefore bucketed into ground tiles, which gives the
 *    culler something the size of a room to reject.
 *
 * A fourth arrived with the fifth pass and turned out to be the loudest: the
 * mid distance was dissolving into a speckled grey wall. That is a
 * minification failure, not a lighting one, and it is fought here on three
 * fronts — coverage-preserving mips in the baker, a roughness and normal clamp
 * that rises with mip level so a leaf a pixel across stops throwing a
 * full-strength mirror lobe, and a floor on the projected width of anything
 * thin so grass blades and vines cannot fall below the sample grid.

/* Per-species bucket size, cull radius, whether it casts, and how many
 * structural variants get built.
 *
 * The first three numbers are the entire performance story of the forest, and
 * they trade against each other. Tiles that are too small multiply draw calls
 * (every tile carries one mesh per variant per material); tiles that are too
 * large stop being cullable. So the bucket is sized to the species: a canopy
 * tree is 30 m of geometry and belongs in a 64 m bucket, a sprig is 20 cm and
 * belongs in a 32 m one.
 *
 * Cull radii are set from what the fog actually lets through — about 40 m at
 * ground level — with a longer leash for anything whose crown sits above it.
 * Shadow casting is off for the two smallest species: they are dense enough to
 * double the shadow pass on their own, and at 20 cm tall neither of them casts
 * a shadow anyone can identify.
 *
 * `v` is where the repetition budget is spent, and it is spent unevenly on
 * purpose. Three variants of everything meant three umbrella palms and three
 * broadleaf clumps repeating across forty metres of understory, which is
 * exactly the range at which the eye starts matching silhouettes. The species
 * that get more are the ones at eye level in the near field; the canopy and
 * the distant thicket keep three, because a shape twenty metres up or sixty
 * metres out is never resolved well enough to be recognised twice. Each extra
 * variant is another InstancedMesh in every tile it appears in, so the tiles
 * for the crowded ground species were widened to pay for it.
 */
/* `near`, where it is present, is the radius inside which the high-detail
 * build of a species is drawn; outside it the tile switches to a coarser
 * tessellation of the same plant. It is what pays for the close-range
 * geometry added in the tenth pass — cupped leaflets, tapered blades, curled
 * litter — none of which is resolvable past about twenty metres and all of
 * which would otherwise be multiplied by the whole forest.
 *
 * A species with `near` also needs a smaller tile, and that is the cost of
 * the scheme: the switch is per tile, so a 40 m bucket straddling the
 * boundary would either hold coarse plants at arm's length or fine ones out
 * at the fog line. Halving the tile roughly doubles that species' draw calls,
 * which is affordable here — the frame runs at about 400 calls — and would
 * not be if the buckets were not already per variant.
 */
/* The three canopy storeys and the vines hanging off them stopped casting into
 * the shadow map when the atmosphere system landed, and the change is a
 * correction rather than an optimisation — though it is also worth around a
 * third of the depth pass, because the roof was the heaviest thing in it.
 *
 * A shadow map asks one question: is the straight line to the light blocked.
 * Under three overlapping storeys of canopy patches the answer at ground level
 * is always yes, measurably — with every other light source switched off and
 * the sun at double strength, the forest floor rendered completely black. So
 * the map was spending most of its resolution and most of its fill rate to
 * produce a constant, and the constant it produced was the reason the frame
 * had no direct light in it anywhere.
 *
 * The roof's occlusion is modelled analytically instead (render/canopy.js),
 * which is the only way to get the thing a shadow map cannot represent: a
 * penumbra that widens with the distance to the occluder. Everything near the
 * ground — trunks, logs, ferns, saplings, the player — still casts, because
 * down there the hard contact shadow is exactly right and the shadow map is
 * now big enough to give it properly. */

/* The underside of a leaf, and why it cannot be the top of one seen from

/* Mip-driven damping, and it is doing more for the mid distance than anything
 * else in this file.
 *
 * Three things go wrong at once when a leaf minifies, and together they are
 * what turns the centre of the frame into a speckled grey wall.
 *
 * The alpha channel loses its meaning first. A leaf card five pixels tall is
 * reading a mip level where its whole 512-pixel atlas cell has collapsed to
 * about four texels, so the holes, the leaflet slots and the chewed margin are
 * all averaged into a handful of mid-range alpha values. Every one of those is
 * below the alpha test, so the card is eroded from every edge at once — and
 * because the thing directly behind the mid distance is bright fog, each leaf
 * ends up outlined in a hard pale rim where the fog shows through the gap
 * between it and the leaf it should be touching. That rim, repeated across a
 * few thousand cards, is the speckled grey wall in the middle of the frame;
 * it is not the leaves that are visible out there, it is the sky between them.
 *
 * So alpha has to be pushed up rather than merely sharpened. Dilating it with
 * mip level closes the gaps and lets many small blades merge into one larger
 * silhouette, which is what real foliage does at that distance anyway, and at
 * mip zero the remap is the identity so nothing in the foreground moves.
 *
 * Then the specular. A card's normal *map* averages to flat but its geometric
 * normal does not, so a thousand randomly oriented sub-pixel cards each hold a
 * full-strength mirror lobe and a random subset catches the sky on any given
 * frame. That is aliasing, not noise, so it does not average away — it
 * sparkles. Raising roughness and flattening the normal with the footprint
 * removes it, and at mip zero both are the identity.

 * disc by another name — and evenness is the thing that gives a procedural
 * forest away even when every individual plant is convincing. Real vegetation
 * is patchy at every scale, because it is competing for light and water that
 * are themselves patchy: a treefall gap grows a near-impassable thicket, and
 * fifteen metres away under closed canopy the floor is almost bare. Modulating
 * the acceptance probability by a slow noise field buys that structure for
 * three lookups per candidate.
