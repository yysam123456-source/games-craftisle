/* The lens and the film: everything between "the scene has finished being lit"
 * and "there are eight-bit pixels on the canvas".
 *
 * This is the tail of the pipeline that render/atmosphere.js begins. That file
 * renders the world into a half-float target, marches mist and shafts through
 * it, occludes it, and composites the three together — and it used to finish
 * the job by tone mapping straight to the canvas. It now stops one step short
 * and hands a linear HDR image to this file instead, which does the optics and
 * the film.
 *
 * The ordering below is not a preference, it is the order the physical events
 * happen in, and every one of these effects looks like a filter if it is put in
 * the wrong place:
 *
 *   1. shutter          the sensor integrates while the camera moves
 *   2. defocus          the lens does not converge every distance on the plane
 *   3. flare / bloom    light scatters inside the glass before it lands
 *   ---- all of the above are radiance, so they happen in linear HDR ----
 *   4. grade + curve    the response of the stock, then the print
 *   5. lateral colour   the glass does not focus the three primaries alike
 *   6. vignette         the barrel cuts the corners of the cone
 *   7. grain            the emulsion is made of particles
 *
 * Only the first three cost anything worth measuring; four through seven are
 * arithmetic inside one full-screen pass that has to run regardless, because
 * that pass is where the single ACES tone map lives.
 *
 * The rule this system was written under is that a viewer must not be able to
 * name any of it. Bloom that can be seen as bloom is too strong, defocus that
 * can be seen as defocus is too strong, and grain that can be counted is far
 * too strong. The measurements that matter are therefore small differences,
 * which is why the parameters here are in physical units — an aperture, a
 * shutter angle, a circle of confusion in pixels — rather than in arbitrary
 * strengths. A number with units can be argued about.

/* What each tier is allowed.
 *
 * The grade, the vignette, the aberration and the grain are not in this table
 * because they are free: they are a few dozen instructions inside the final
 * pass, and the final pass exists at every tier because something has to tone
 * map. What costs money is anything that fetches the frame more than once, so
 * that is what the tiers move.
 *
 * `bloom` is a mip count, `dof` a tap count and `motion` a tap count; zero
 * means the pass is not run at all rather than run at strength zero.
 *
 * Every tier gets every effect, and the first version of this table did not:
 * defocus and the shutter were high and ultra only, on the reasoning that a
 * machine that has fallen to `low` needs the milliseconds more than it needs
 * the optics. Measured, that reasoning was wrong twice. The cost is 0.05 ms at
 * six taps, which is a third of a per cent of a frame on hardware slow enough
 * to be down here; and the thing being economised on is not a garnish, it is
 * the difference between a lens and a pinhole. Half the quality ladder was
 * shipping a look that had never been reviewed, which is the more expensive
 * outcome by a wide margin. The tiers scale the *sampling* of each effect
 * rather than its presence, so what changes going down is how much noise is in
 * the answer, not whether the answer is there.

 * guarantee rather than a matter of taste — the warm olive palette this scene
 * has been praised for is a couple of per cent of blue gain away from reading
 * cyan, and a grade is exactly the kind of thing that gets nudged later by
 * someone who does not know that.
 *
 * The magnitudes are all small on purpose. The image arriving here is already
 * a good one; the job is to make it look like it went through a camera, and
 * the difference between footage and a render is not a large colour move, it
 * is a set of small ones that are all consistent with the same piece of glass
 * and the same stock.
 *
 * There is a known, deliberately unaddressed complaint against these numbers.
 * Warmth here is got half out of blue and half out of putting red up — a slope
 * of 1.018 and an exponent of 0.990 — and red rising against green is green
 * falling against red, so the grade narrows the green channel's lead over the
 * red: measured, the sunlit canopy goes from a lead of 4.9 code values to 1.7
 * and the falls from -0.3 to -2.4. That is a real finding and the reading it
 * produces — warm, not cyan, and khaki — is a real weakness of the image.
 *
 * It is not a post-processing defect and it is not fixed here. The green a
 * jungle reads by is mostly the light that has been *through* a leaf, and this
 * scene has very little of that; a grade cannot manufacture channel separation
 * that the render did not hand it, it can only redistribute what is there and
 * take the cyan risk above while doing so. Whoever picks this up should start
 * in the vegetation and lighting materials and come back to these numbers
 * afterwards, not the other way round.

/* Motion blur, reconstructed from depth and where the camera was last frame.

 * stage. What is available for free is the depth buffer and the previous

 * all of the motion there is: the camera is moving through a forest that is
 * standing still, and the parts genuinely moving on their own — leaves in the
 * wind, falling water, spray — are moving slowly enough at their scale that
 * their own blur would be a fraction of a pixel.
 *
 * The waterfall is the interesting exception and it is the reason the critic
 * asked for this. Its curtain is scrolling texture on nearly static geometry,
 * so a velocity buffer would report it as motionless too; what actually reads
 * as motion in a photograph of a fall is the camera's own drift smearing the
 * whole clearing, and that is precisely what this reconstructs.
 *
 * Shutter angle rather than a strength: a film camera's shutter is open for
 * some fraction of the frame interval, one hundred and eighty degrees being

 * failure the brief names, a leaf thirty centimetres from the lens rendering
 * razor sharp, is not a stylistic choice that a renderer makes; it is a thing
 * no camera has ever done. The second is that the far half is deliberately
 * feeble. At a focus of a few metres the far circle of confusion tends to a
 * limit of two or three pixels however distant the subject, and that limit is
 * the whole far-field effect: enough to take the last of the aliasing off the
 * far bank, not enough to be seen as an effect.
 *
 * The depth taken for the downsampled texel is the *nearest* of the four, not

   * same amplitude would be several times more visible in the shadows than in
   * the highlights, because that is what the sRGB curve does to a small
   * perturbation down there, and this frame is mostly shadows.
   *
   * The amplitude is modulated by a parabola in the encoded value for the
   * usual reason: silver halide grain is visible where some grains have been
   * developed and some have not, so it peaks in the midtones and vanishes in
   * clear film and in solid black. That curve is a quarter of the amplitude in
   * deep shadow, its full value across the 102-128 band, and two thirds of it
   * in the shoulder, which is the shape a measurement of a real stock has.
   *
   * A per-channel component on top of a shared one, because a colour negative
   * has three independently grainy layers, and grain that is purely luminance
   * reads as video noise rather than as film.
   *
   * The amplitude is set in code values so that it can be argued about, and it
   * is set by measurement rather than by eye. Measured means differenced: a pair
   * of frames identical in every respect but this term, so the difference is the
   * noise field itself and its standard deviation is not an estimate. At nine
   * code values of amplitude that field measures a luminance sigma of 1.60 at the
   * peak of the parabola, 1.24 averaged over a whole frame, and it holds its
   * shape against level — 0.88 in deep shadow, 1.60 across the 102-128 band,
   * 0.84 in the shoulder. A scanned thirty-five millimetre frame is in that
   * range.
   *
   * Three versions of this number and two of them were wrong in ways nothing in
   * the picture showed. At 1.15 it measured 0.83 against 0.80 for no grain at
   * all, which is to say it was quantised away before it reached the file. At 5.0
   * it measured 0.72, and 0.72 is present but under the threshold at which grain
   * does the one thing it is here for: this frame is soft, softer than the
   * footage it is aiming at, and a soft frame with no grain in it reads as a
   * render however good the optics above it are. Of every knob in this file that
   * was the one with the most left to give.
   *
   * The arithmetic checks out and is worth writing down, because the reason to
   * trust the measurement is that it agrees with a prediction made separately. A
   * uniform variate on a unit interval has a standard deviation of 0.289, so nine
   * code values of it is 2.60 per channel; half the field is shared between the
   * channels and half is independent, and the luminance weights take
   * sqrt(0.25 + 0.25 * (0.2126^2 + 0.7152^2 + 0.0722^2)) = 0.625 of that. 1.63
   * predicted against 1.60 measured. What no amount of that arithmetic gives is
   * the frame average, because that depends on where the picture's levels
   * actually sit on the parabola, and it is the number the README should quote:
   * 1.24 here, and it will differ at another stop.
   *
   * Half of it is shared between the channels and half is not. All-shared is
   * luminance noise, which is what a sensor makes and not what an emulsion
   * makes; all-independent is chroma noise, which is the most visible kind per
   * unit of standard deviation and the one that reads as a bad JPEG.
